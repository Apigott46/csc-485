This project, **"Modeling Pitcher/Hitter Match-Ups Using Factor Analysis"**, aims to analyze MLB pitcher-hitter interactions using advanced statistical methods to uncover key insights. By leveraging metrics like wOBA, spin rate, and hot zones, it identifies influential factors and develops predictive models. Tools such as factor analysis, PCA, and logistic regression support this research. The outcomes will include real-time decision-making tools and actionable strategies for MLB teams to optimize player performance and refine in-game strategies.
